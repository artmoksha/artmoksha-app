These types of deities first appeared in India during the late 6th century with its main source being the Yaksha imagery and became a central feature of Indian Tantric Buddhism by the late 10th or early 11th century",

When someone says Buddha we will often picture the historical Buddha but it is necessary to understand that the word Buddha is actually referring to any enlightened being.",
